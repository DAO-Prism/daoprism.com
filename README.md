# DAO Prism

DAO Prism is now built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) using the latest starter configuration. The site renders a single-page canvas centered around the prism artwork.

## Getting started

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs at http://localhost:4321.

## Production build

```sh
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Static assets such as `central_image.png`, `central_image_transparent.png`, and the `CNAME` file are served from the `public/` directory.
